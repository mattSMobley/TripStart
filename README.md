# TripStart

TripStart is an app that pulls in information about a city from various sources, all to one location.
When trying to decide where you would like to travel, there are several things to consider. Weather, prices, attractions, timezone, currency, etc. When I am interested in a destination, I look at 6 or 7 different websites to get information.
TripStart brings all of this information to one page!
