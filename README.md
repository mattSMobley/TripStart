# TripStart

TripStart is an app that pulls in information about a city from various sources, all to one location.
When trying to decide where you would like to travel, there are several things to consider. Weather, prices, attractions, timezone, currency, etc. When I am interested in a destination, I look at 6 or 7 different websites to get information.
TripStart brings all of this information to one page!

# How To Use

TripStart is a very simple application. Simply enter the first few letters of the city you would like to learn about, and select it from the dropdown box. Some places can be hard to spell, so an autocomplete feature provides you with a list of available cities, from around the world, that match the first few letters of your query.

# Work in Progress

TripStart is a work in progress, and therefore will be updated periodically to enhance the information presented to the user. There are several new features in the works, but feel free to leave me any comments you'd like!
